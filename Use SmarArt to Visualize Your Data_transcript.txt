Welcome back. In the last task, you learned how to insert
a Youtube video to your slides.
Starting your video at a certain time stamp, resizing
the video on the slide and adding a title on top of the video.
In this task you learn how to use SmartArt in your
presentation.
A SmartArt graphic is a visual representation of your
information and ideas.
You create one by choosing a layout that fits your message.
Now go to the first slide.
You will see a company's product release, timeline
and future opportunities.
Let's make the slide more interesting.
And visual through SmartArt.
Let's see the different types of SmartArt that we can use.
First of all we go to the menu bar, click insert.
Then here you click on the SmartArt and you have different
types of SmartArt. A list, a cycle, a process, hierarchy
and timeline.
A few options to choose from here.
I know it can be confusing at first, but let me guide you.
When do you choose list?
You choose list when you want to show non-sequential
information.
You pick cycle when you want to show a continual process
and you pick process when you want to show steps in a process
or timeline and you can pick hierarchy when you want to show
an organizational chart or a decision tree.
And finally, you have timeline to show a timeline.
In our case there is a timeline we want to visualize.
So we can pick either process or we can just pick timeline
and I think timeline in this case seems more convenient.
So let's pick a shape that looks fitting maybe this one.
So as usual the shape is inserted in the middle of the slide.
So let's move it here.
...
And for now let's move this text down.
Let's drag it down here.
Just here is good.
And then move this text as well.
Here is good.
And let's move our SmartArt to be here as we're going to
transfer the information of this timeline to the SmartArt.
So let's make it visual.
Maybe we can move this SmartArt a bit of the right.
And move this a bit to the left.
We are going to rearrange the whole slide again
after we finish the SmartArt.
So let's start. When you click on the SmartArt, there's a
text pane that appears here.
The text pane has two levels.
The first level is the one inside the arrow and the second
level is the text that appears here.
As you can see here the default of a SmartArt timeline is
only three arrows and in our timeline we actually have five
months.
So we want to do five arrows on two levels.
So to do that, you just go to the last bullet and click enter
and since we have pressed enter after a second level,
bullet by default, the new bullet is on the second level and
that doesn't solve our problem and doesn't create a new arrow
to the timeline.
So to promote this bullet to be a first level instead of a
second level in the menu bar, SmartArt. You'll see two hours
here, one is promote and the other is demote.
In our case, we want to promote the bullet, so we click this
arrow and here you go, it has been promoted to first level
and now we have four arrows, but here the second level is
empty, so again we press enter and it creates a new level,
but we want this level to be a second level, not a first
level. So again we go to the menu bar and click on demote.
So now we have four arrows with first and second levels.
So let's repeat these steps to add one more month to the
timeline.
Again I press enter then promote, enter again, and demote.
So now let's transfer that timeline.
That's a text right now to the SmartArt.
So in the first level we want to have the months written
inside them and in the second level, we want to have the
step name.
So let's start, first of all is January, where there is
initiation, then there is February, where there is negotiation then
March where we have standardization then April and down and
debriefing then in May we do the handing over and here you go.
All the information are now transferred inside the SmartArt
January, initiation, February, negotiation and all of the
months. Now we don't need the text of the timeline here
because we already transferred it to the SmartArt.
So let's go to the shape, click on the shape.
And press delete.
Oh here you go.
And then put the shape here.
Delete again. Delete.
And finally click on this shape and press delete to delete it.
Now we have a cleaner slide.
So let's maximize our SmartArt to fill the slide.
You click on it and drag its edge to extend it to the slide
and let's fit it like that.
As you can see the font size was automatically adjusted
but we still can do some more adjustments like font type and
font color and we can make it bolder.
You can just select the text you want to amend here in the
text pane.
You can select for the example othis one and change its
font or you can choose another color for it.
Let's say red.
It's an important phase.
So we want to make it in red here.
Here, tt changes to red and also May is an important month for us.
So we want to highlight it, make it more visual.
So we can select the text that says May inside the text pane
and choose bold and inside the SmartArt would be bolder than the
other months and we're not done yet.
You can actually kind of change the shape of the SmartArt.
You can keep the timeline, you can keep the arrows and the
first and secnd levels and at the same time change the shape and
the color of the SmartArt.
So in the menu bar, you click on SmartArt, you can click
here to see some color options.
These are your options, you can make it colorful, you can
make it one color and you can make one color with different
shades.
So let's pick a colorful one just for fun.
And here you go.
Each month has a different color and you can also change the
shape or the style of your SmartArt by clicking here.
A SmartArt style is a combination of effects such as
line style, bevel or 3D.
You can pick one that fits your presentation style.
So here let's try one of them.
Maybe you can try this one.
I think it looks nice.
So now to make the slide look nicer.
Let's realign the elements in our slide.
First of all is the slide title.
We can move it a bit to the corner.
Here is good. and let's move our SmartArt a bit to the
left so it can be in the center of the slide and let's move
the text to the center of the slide as well.
You will probably not be able to pick this text because the
SmartArt is on top of it.
So you select the SmartArt, then click on these three dots
in the menu bar.
Arrange, click on it, and and "Send to back".
Now you'll be able to select this text.
So let's move it to the center.
And let's pick this and move to the center as well.
And now we have a nice-looking slide with visual data instead
of text which is more engaging and it would make your
audience remember your presentation.
Now let's practice.
Let's go to the fifth slide. Here you have a cycle that's
written as a list and we want it to be a SmartArt instead.
The SmartArt should only have one level and it should be
yellow and you can pick the SmartArt style that you like.
I also want you to rearrange the text inside the slide by
moving this text to be in the bottom center of the slide and
move this text to be in the top left corner of the slide.
Now pause the video, do the exercise and when you're done,
continue with the video and I will show you how I did this
task to compare your step to mine. Welcome back, let's do the
exercise together.
So first of all the list we have is a cycle.
So the type of that SmartArt we choose should be a cycle.
So we click and insert. SmartArt and we pick one of the
cycles.
I think this one looks good.
Click on it.
It already has five steps.
So we will not have to add any steps.
Let's select the SmartArt and move it a bit to the right so
we can see the text and then start typing inside the text
pane. So here's the first thing we copy from the cycle is
initiation and negotiation and standardization, briefing,
handing over.
We now do not need this text.
So let's delete it.
So click on the shape and delete.
Again and delete.
Select this.
...
Delete. Again delete.
Let's move this text to the bottom center. Like that. Remove
this one as well.
We can move that a bit upwards.
Then we move the SmartArt to the center, we move the
slide title to the top left and to change the color of the
SmartArt, we select it, we pick SmartArt from the menu bar,
Click here. Let's choose yellow.
Great job! In this task,
you learned how to use SmartArt in your presentation.
In the next task you will learn how to animate the content of your
slide.
